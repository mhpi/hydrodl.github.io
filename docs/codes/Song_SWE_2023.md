# LSTM Snow Water Equivalent model

## Code Release

I will eventually release the code...

## Short Summary
We tested an LSTM network with data integration (DI) for snow water equivalent (SWE) in the western US to integrate 30-day-lagged or 7-day-lagged observations of either SWE or satellite-observed snow cover fraction (SCF) to improve future predictions. SCF proved beneficial only for shallow-snow sites during snowmelt, while lagged SWE integration significantly improved prediction accuracy for both shallow-and deep-snow sites. The median Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) in temporal testing improved from 0.92 to 0.97 with 30-day-lagged SWE integration, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the difference between estimated and observed peak SWE values (dmax ) were reduced by 41% and 57%, respectively.
