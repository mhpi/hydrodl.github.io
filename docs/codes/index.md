-   [Updated, simplified __$\delta$HBV tutorial__ for CAMELS streamflow] [tutorialdHBV]
  
    --- 
This notebook is a simplified $\delta$HBV code tutorial for CAMELS streamflow. Thanks to Yalan Song and Dapeng Feng. Note that different pytorch versions could lead to slightly different performances.

### LSTM Models

-   [Starting point: Quick __LSTM tutorial__ on soil moisture prediction] [tutorial1]
  
    --- 
This notebook is the starting point for new people to learn hydrologic time series prediction using deep neural networks. You can see how CudnnLSTMmodel and CpuLSTM models are trained and how data are formatted. Dataset is embedded in the hydroDL library so it is easy to run the example.

-   [Updated, simplified __LSTM tutorial__ for CAMELS streamflow] [tutorial2]
  
    --- 
This notebook is the "high-flow expert" listed on the benchmark page. We greatly simplified the LSTM interface, making it easy to reuse this code on your data. This is slightly more involved than the soil moisture tutorial as we are dealing with a larger and more complex dataset. Thanks to Yalan Song, Kamlesh Sawadekar and Dapeng Feng. Note that different pytorch versions could lead to slightly different performances.

    --- 
![Transformer_model](../assets/project-figures/liu_2024.jpg){align="left" width="120"}
First time Transformer achieved the same performance as LSTM on CAMELS dataset; LSTMs and Transformers are likely nearing the prediction limits of the dataset.
