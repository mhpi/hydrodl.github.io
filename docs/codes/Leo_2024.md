# generic_deltaModel (gMD)
![Alt text](../assets/project-figures/gMD.png)

## Short Summary
A domain-agnostic, PyTorch-based framework for developing trainable differentiable models that merge neural networks with process-based equations. "Differentiable" means that gradient calculations can be achieved efficiently at large scale throughout the model, so process-based equations can be trained together with NNs on big data, on GPU. Following as a generalization of HydroDL, generic_deltaModel (or DeltaModel) aims to expand differentiable modeling and learning capabilities to a wide variety of domains where prior equations can bring in benefits.

Closely synergizes with deep learning tools and the scale advantage of PyTorch. Maintained by (MHPI group) advised by Dr. Chaopeng Shen.
