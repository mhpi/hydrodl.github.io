# 𝛿MG

## The Generic, Scalable Differentiable Modeling Framework
<!-- ![Alt text](../assets/project-figures/dMG.png) -->


`𝛿MG` is a domain-agnostic, PyTorch-based framework for developing trainable differentiable models that merge neural networks with process-based equations.

The `hydroDL2` repository for hydrology models couples with the 𝛿MG framework to enable MHPI-specific hydrologic modeling capabilities. The combination serves both as a benchmark capability for published results (including those that used hydroDL) and an exploratory platform for future hydrology research in MHPI.

Closely synergizes with deep learning tools and the scale advantage of PyTorch. Maintained by the [MHPI group](http://water.engr.psu.edu/shen/) advised by Dr. Chaopeng Shen.
