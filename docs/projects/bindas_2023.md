  ![Manning's n recovery against USGS Data](../assets/project-figures/bindas_2023.png){ width="600" }
  <figcaption>The learned relationship between n and drainage area (square kilometers) for the Juniata River basin according to the trained graph neural network. (a) The distribution of river segments by Manningâ€™s n and drainage area on a linear scale. (b) The same distribution, but on a logarithmic scale with a logarithmic trendline. The network was trained for the period of 2001/02/01 to 2001/03/29. Each dot in the scatter plot represents a 2-km river reach.</figcaption>
